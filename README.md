# Data_Cleaning_and_Exploratory_Data_Analysis_Project_in_MySQL

## Overview
This project demonstrates my SQL programming skills through data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using a real-world dataset on global layoffs from 2020–2023. The goal was to transform messy, inconsistent data into clean, usable insights — mirroring a realistic analytics workflow.
